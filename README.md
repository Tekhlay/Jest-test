# Jest-test

In this exercise, i have written a few practical tests for JavaScript functions using the Jest library. I have also followed the AAA pattern(Arrange, Act and Assert) to make testing much efficent and easier for other developers to read and understand. I have also tries to use the Test Driven Development(TDD) approach in my practice.
